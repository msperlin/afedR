```{r datageneration, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
# no data generation

```

Question
========

In RStudio, create a new _script_ and save it in a personal folder. Now, write R commands in the script that define two objects: one holding a sequence between 1 and 100 and the other with the text of your name (ex. 'Richard'). Execute the whole script with the keyboard shortcuts.


Solution
================

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 1:100
y <- 'Richard'

# press control+shift+enter to run this chunk of code in RStudio
```


Meta-information
================
extype: string
exsolution: `r mchoice2string(c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE), single = TRUE)`
exname: "Basic"
exshuffle: TRUE
