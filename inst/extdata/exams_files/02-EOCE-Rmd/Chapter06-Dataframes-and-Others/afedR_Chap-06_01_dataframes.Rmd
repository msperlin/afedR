```{r solution, eval=TRUE}
my_df <- dplyr::tibble(x = -100:100, 
                        y = x + 5)
# solution
my_sol <- sum((my_df$x > 10)&(my_df$x < 25))
```

```{r datageneration, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
my_answers <- make_random_answers(my_sol)

#check_answers(my_answers)
```

Question
========

Using function `dplyr::tibble`, create a `dataframe` called `my_df` with a column called `x` containing a sequence from -100 to 100 and another column called `y` with the value of column x added by 5. How many values in column `x` are greater than 10 and lower than 25?

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
exams::answerlist(my_answers, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
================

```{r solution, eval=FALSE}
```
