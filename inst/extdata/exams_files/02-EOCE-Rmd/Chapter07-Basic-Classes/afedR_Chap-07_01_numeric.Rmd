```{r solution, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
set.seed(7)

x <- sample (1:3, size = 5, replace = T)
y <- sample (1:3, size = 5, replace = T)

# solution
my_sol <- sum(x*y)
```

```{r datageneration, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
my_answers <- make_random_answers(my_sol)

#check_answers(my_answers)
```

Question
========

Consider the following vectors x and y:

```{r}
set.seed(7)
x <- sample (1:3, size = 5, replace = T)
y <- sample (1:3, size = 5, replace = T)
```

What is the sum of the elements of a new vector resulting from the multiplication between the elements of `x` and` y`?


```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
exams::answerlist(my_answers, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
================

```{r solution, eval=FALSE}
```
