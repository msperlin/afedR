```{r solution, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", warning=FALSE}
my_sum <- cumsum(1:100)

# solution
my_sol <- (which(my_sum > 50)[1])
```

```{r datageneration, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
my_answers <- make_random_answers(my_sol)

#check_answers(my_answers)
```

Question
========

If we performed a cumulative sum of a sequence between 1 and 100, in what element would this sum go beyond the value of 50?

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
exams::answerlist(my_answers, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
================

```{r solution, eval=FALSE}
```
