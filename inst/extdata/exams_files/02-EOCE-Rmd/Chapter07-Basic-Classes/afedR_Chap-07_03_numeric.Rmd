```{r solution, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
# solution
seq_1 <- seq(from = -15, to = 10, by = 2)

# solution
my_sol <- sum(seq_1)
```

```{r datageneration, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
my_answers <- make_random_answers(my_sol)

#check_answers(my_answers)
```

Question
========

Using R, create an sequence called `seq_1` between -15 and 10, where the interval between values is always equal to 2. What is the sum of the elements of `seq_1`?

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
exams::answerlist(my_answers, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
================

```{r solution, eval=FALSE}
```
