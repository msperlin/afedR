```{r solution, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", warning=FALSE}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 10, sd = 10)

my_group <- cut(x, 
                breaks = c(-Inf, 15, Inf))

# solution
my_sol <- table(my_group)[1]
```

```{r datageneration, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
my_answers <- make_random_answers(my_sol)

#check_answers(my_answers)
```

Question
========

Using `set.seed (10)`, create an object called `x` with random values from the Normal distribution with a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 10. Using the `cut` function, create another object that defines two groups based on values of `x` greater than 15 and lower than 15. How many observations you find in the first group?


```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
exams::answerlist(my_answers, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
================

```{r solution, eval=FALSE}
```
