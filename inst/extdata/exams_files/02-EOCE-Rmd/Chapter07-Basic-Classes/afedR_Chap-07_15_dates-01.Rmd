```{r solution, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", cache=TRUE}
b_day <- as.Date('2000-05-12')
n_years <- 100

b_day_vec <- seq(b_day, b_day + n_years*365, by = '1 year')

w_days <- weekdays(b_day_vec)

n_weekend <- sum(w_days %in% c('Saturday', 'Sunday'))

Question
========

Assuming that a person born on `r b_day` will live for `r n_years` years, what is the number of birthday days that will fall on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday)? Tip: use operator `%in%` to check for a multiple condition in a vector.

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
exams::answerlist(my_answers, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
================

```{r solution, eval=FALSE}
```
