Question
========

For the same daily FTSE data, check the dates and prices of the 20 biggest price drops. If, for each of these cases, an investor bought the index at the price of the biggest drops and kept it for 30 days, what would be his average nominal return per transaction?

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
exams::answerlist(my_answers, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
================

```{r solution, eval=FALSE}
```
